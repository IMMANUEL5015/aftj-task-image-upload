# AFTJ IMAGE UPLOAD TASK

## Description
This project is an API which allows an image to be uploaded.

When the image uploads successfully, the endpoint responds with the image url.

If for any reason (**for instance uploading a spreadsheet document instead of an image file**) 
the upload fails, the endpoint will respond with an appropriate error message.
